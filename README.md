## <a name="description">Description</a> ##

The Open Fortran Parser (OFP) project provides a Fortran 2008 compliant
parser and associated tools.  These tools provide a Java and C API for
actions that are called when parser rules are completed.  These actions
allow a parser consumer to build a custom Abstract Syntax Tree ([AST]).

If you need access to a complete source-to-source Fortran compiler
infrastructure incorporating OFP, please consider using [ROSE].

The OFP parser is based on an [ANTLR] 3 grammar and ANTLR version 3.5.2
tools are used to generate the Fortran parser (written in Java).
The C action interfaces are currently provided by JNI.

### <a name="installation-instructions">Installation instructions</a>  ###

  - See the [INSTALL] file.

### <a name="documentation">Documentation</a>   ###

  - Still a little sparse.  Action interfaces are defined by the [Java file]

### <a name="running-the-parser">Running the parser</a> ###

  - Set your java [CLASSPATH] to include the ANTLR jar files and 
    OpenFortranParser-0.8.7.jar.  If you use the bash shell, you can set the
    CLASSPATH with something like (assuming files are installed in /usr/local):
```bash
  export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/antlr/lib/antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar:/usr/local/ofp/lib/OpenFortranParser-0.8.7.jar
```
  - Run the parser with the command
```bash
  java fortran.ofp.FrontEnd [--verbose] filename
```
### <a name="help">Help</a> ###

  - Please submit problem reports or feature requests via our [Issues] page.
  - Please send questions to fortran-parser-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

### <a name="git-repository">git Repository</a>  ###

  - The public is free to clone the most recent copy of the [OFP] git repository
    repository and experiment with the tools.  To submit changes,
    please fork the repository, branch on your fork, and submit a pull request
